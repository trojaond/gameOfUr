# About
The Royal Game of Ur, also known as the Game of Twenty Squares, is a two-player strategy race board game that was first played in ancient Mesopotamia during the early 3000 BC. The Game of Ur remained popular until late antiquity, when it stopped being played, possibly evolving into, or being displaced by, an early form of backgammon. It was eventually forgotten everywhere except among the Jewish population of the Indian city of Kochi, who continued playing a version of it until the 1950s when they began emigrating to Israel.
